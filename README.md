# 8XLib v0.0.1
A tiny library aimed at providing some niche functionality that you may need for your game.

*List does not represent the currently released/prelease code
This library is for you if you want at least one or two of these :
- A developer console
- A tiny timer system with the ability to control multiple timers at once
- A simple and modular animation system
- A simple camera system with very minimal setup
- A resolution manager with minimal setup
- An event handler to make object communication easier
- A simple bitflag system for your game
- Vectors
- A Custom A Star implementation
- Goal Oriented Action Planning AI

<b>Now this all sounds well and good, but this is still very much a work in progress library, so feel free to contribute!</b>
